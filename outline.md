# Weather Chatbot Project Report Outline

## Abstract
This project presents an AI-powered Weather Chatbot system that leverages expert system concepts to provide intelligent weather information and recommendations. The system combines natural language processing capabilities with a rule-based expert system to understand user queries and deliver accurate weather forecasts. By integrating with the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) Open Data API, the chatbot processes real-time weather data and applies expert knowledge rules to generate meaningful responses. The system features a user-friendly interface built with React for the frontend and a robust Flask-based backend that handles data processing and decision-making. The expert system component enables the chatbot to make intelligent inferences about weather patterns and provide contextual recommendations based on various weather parameters including temperature, humidity, wind conditions, and UV index. This implementation demonstrates the practical application of expert systems in weather forecasting and information dissemination, showcasing how AI can enhance user experience in accessing weather-related information.
